ME 405 Term Project
-----------
This ROMI robot project was implemented and developed by Dane Carroll and Kassandra Martinez-Mejia. The goal for the project is
the ROMI robot must complete a track with distinct turns and obstacles as it makes its way back to the starting point. 

This ROMI uses:
* [Romi Robot Kit](https://www.pololu.com/product/3501)
* [QTR-8RC Reflectance Sensor Array](https://www.pololu.com/product/961)
* [BNO055 IMU](https://www.adafruit.com/product/2472)
* [Bump Sensor](https://www.pololu.com/product/1402)

Hardware Implementation
----------
**Line Sensor** 

We implemented our sensor based on the interfacing information provided in the Pololu website. In lab 4, the line sensor was able to read black and white datums based on the discharging times of the RC sensors. Then, we would normalize the readings with the values of the white and black datums. Lastly, we calculate the centroid of the sensor readings to then be able to adjust the motor efforts based on the error in centroid location. Unfortunately, the line sensor was not consistent enough to work properly for our final term project due to the a multitude of resons, namely the variations in room lighting and the reflectivity of the game track surface. 


**IMU**

We used a BNO055 IMU sensor to detect changes in orientation and measure headings, euler angles, angular velcity, and the yaw rate.

**Bump Sensor**

We implemented a bumper sensor using a GPIO pin that has a pull-up resistor. Also, we created a Python class for the bump sensor to update the pressed state of the sensor and adjust for debounce timing using a timer.

Software Implementation
-------------
Throughout the quarter, we used Python classes to organize our code and shares and queues to update flags for specific tasks (motor, IMU, and data) on the scheduler. Also, we implement finite state machines (FSMs) for easy transistions to control Romi's movements. Due to the inconsistencies in results when using the line following sensor to complete the track, we decided to make a somewhat last minute pivot and instead break the track into a series of segmented vectors. In our final project implementation, we used a used these vectors by taking a target heading and drive distance using the IMU and encoder counts. This greatly simplified the code and made Romi's movements much more reliable, however with the limited time we were unable to finely tune the necessary encoder counts and angles in order to get Romi to consistently finish the track.

**Motor Task**

We begin with initalizing the base effort of motors, the PID coefficents, encoders, and bump sensor. Once the IMU is calibrated, Romi begins to check for the current segment and the encoder's position and then transitions either to DRIVE, TURN, BUMP, BACKUP or END states. In the DRIVE state, we used a cascaded controller using proportional-integral control on the error between the target heading and the current heading reading, and proportional control on the error between left and right wheel velocities measured by the encoder. This allowed Romi to find the correct heading and drive as straight as possible. In TURN state, the heading error is again used to control the efforts in the left and right motors. Using proportional integral control and saturating the motor efforts, we can control the yaw rate and ensure that Romi is pointed in the right direction before beginning the next Drive segment. The BUMP and BACKUP states are used to detect and respond to the portion of the track where Romi interacts with the wall. In the END state, Romi comes to a stop.

**IMU Task**

Initializes the IMU and calibrates the IMU's magnetometer, accelerometer and gyroscope. In the Initialization state, the IMU takes an average of ten headings to calibrate the starting heading. This starting heading is normalized and used as a new reference point of 0 degrees for the remainder of the program. By referencing from 0, programming turns is made much easier. After initializing, this task updates the current heading share for use in the motor task.

**Data Task**

The data task will print out current heading, distance, and velociy of the motors.

Instructions for Romi Robot
---------------
1. Calibrate IMU by rotating the Romi chassis around until it reads a value of 3 for magnetometer, accelerometer and gyroscope.
2. Calibrate Romi's starting heading by swaying Romi back and forth. 
3. Observe Romi's behavior as it is reading black lines on the track.
4. Adjust PID constants to ensure that Romi's behavior and movements are best suited for the track.
5. Adjust the IMU and make sure Romi is configured with the initial heading.
6. Compile and upload the code onto the microcontroller.
7. Place the robot on the track to initiate line segment program. 


Conclusion
---------------
Even though Romi wasnâ€™t able to complete the track, we were able to learn on how to implement our own robot using proportional-integral-derivative controls, FSMs, headings, and task scheduler.
